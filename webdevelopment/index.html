        <h2>What's on this website?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>My name is Yupei Duan, and I consider myself a learner, an educator, and a researcher—three roles that reflect both my past experiences and my aspirations for the future.</p>
        <p>My journey has taken me from grade school to graduate school, and from a small village in China to the whole world. I have worked for many years as a middle school science teacher and administrator. Currently, I am a Ph.D. student and research assistant in the School of Information Science and Learning Technologies at the University of Missouri.</p>
        <p>I am passionate about sharing scientific knowledge and helping learners engage with STEM subjects more effectively and efficiently—especially through the use of emerging technologies like Virtual Reality and Artificial Intelligence.</p>
        <p>The questions <em>What?, Why?, and How?</em> Constantly fuel my curiosity and drive my exploration of the world. Through this website, I hope to share that curiosity and passion with you.</p>
