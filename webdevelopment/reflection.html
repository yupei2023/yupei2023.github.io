        <h2>Science as Sunshine</h2>
      </header>

      <!-- first paragraph gets its own class -->
      <p class="intro">
        I am a passionate lover of science learning, and I want to share that love with others. To me, science is like sunshine—it brings brightness, warmth, and energy into my life. I hope to invite more people to experience the same brightness, warmth, and strength that come from learning science. Technology is my most powerful tool to help share this passion with a wider audience.
      </p>

      <p>
        I resonate deeply with John Dewey’s statement, “Education is life itself,” and I also draw inspiration from Han Yu, a great Chinese educator. Han believed that an excellent teacher should transmit wisdom, impart knowledge, and resolve doubts—principles I strive to uphold in my work.
      </p>

      <p>
        Moreover, I hope that the technologies we use can enhance learners’ motivation and engagement in ways that traditional methods cannot. In my view, ideal technology-enhanced education should meet the following four criteria: (1) interesting, useful, or meaningful knowledge is effectively disseminated; (2) knowledge transcends barriers of time, space, and cognition; (3) both learners and educators benefit from the process; (4) the transmission of conscience remains the core goal that distinguishes education from other industries.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ultimately, my teaching philosophy can be summarized in three verbs: <strong>listen, iterate, liberate</strong>. By listening to students’ needs, iterating on instructional design through evidence, and liberating learners to become autonomous thinkers, I aim to make science education as warm and empowering for them as sunshine has been for me.
