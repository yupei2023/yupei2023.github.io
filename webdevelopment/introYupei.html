     About Me:

Welcome to my website! My name is Yupei Duan, and I consider myself a learner, an educator, and a researcher—three roles that reflect both my past experiences and my aspirations for the future.

My journey has taken me from grade school to graduate school, and from a small village in China to the wider world. I worked for many years as a middle school science teacher and administrator. Currently, I am a Ph.D. student and research assistant in the School of Information Science and Learning Technologies at the University of Missouri.

I am passionate about sharing scientific knowledge and helping learners engage with STEM subjects more effectively and efficiently—especially through the use of emerging technologies like Virtual Reality and Artificial Intelligence. The questions What?, Why?, and How? constantly fuel my curiosity and drive my exploration of the world. Through this website, I hope to share that curiosity and passion with you.
